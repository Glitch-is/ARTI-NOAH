# Data Parsing

We used [Conchylicultor DeepQA's](https://github.com/Conchylicultor/DeepQA/tree/master/chatbot/corpus) data parsing classes
that he used in his project. Data parsing was not a part of this assignment and we deemed it uneccesary when someone had
already solved this problem. We decided to rather focus on the Machine Learning part.

Thanks Conchylicultor.
