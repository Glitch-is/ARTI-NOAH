i know, i know, i'm white. but i don't even hear it. obv it exists. but largely a media/machine concept at this point. to distract
the magic of trump, and i'll admit he's talented, is that he gets ppl to co-sign on heinous stuff under the guise of "america 1st"
i wish their secondary could have been tested by a competent qb

you're originally from syracuse? i lived there years ago. moving out was one of the happiest days of my life! :)
out here reppin
damn straight
blood clot in brain: fine now debilitating cough: allergies carried after a collapse: just heat but you can totally trust she's fit to lead!
and that's what they admit! god knows what they are hiding
they need to work something out, this whole situation is retarded.
their biggest fear is user manipulation of certain trophies with the use of mods. dead serious.
the cowboys got the redskins after a monday night loss on a short week. now they get the bears after a monday night loss on a short week
and the bears have gotten pretty beaten up tonight.
i'm going to see if my place offers it but i think they only do regular physical therapy

who the chicago tribune reporters picked in this game (h/t , )

australia's immigration policy is official tissue. if you can swim thru the great barrier reef they will let you in the country

fair question but majority of aussies not actively religious; only a fraction of religious minority bigoted.
true. yet conservatives have hijacked “christian” while christian churches stay silent &amp; let acl lead
when men claiming to be women put out statements like this ""my heels are a political statement" one has to choke.
make statements of spectrum, non binary and many more including transgendered identity. awareness + acceptance for u,me+them!

no it's the distain people have for hillary clinton they look at the media in the same light and nothing worst than a liar
most about mexican, blacks what have you got to lose, most about muslims, which wasn't is easier..
what was racist about anything he said?
jimmy fallon thinks its funny that we have a disgusting racist misogynist insane piece of shit running 4 president. ur pathetic
he'll also have hillary on and she's responsible for killing thousands of civilians in drone attacks.
make help the culture of communities.
hillary is winning! why? she puts kids first. she has good ethics. it is also why she is made an object of scorn by some.

...i don't mean where he was born, but how islam influenced his thinking &amp; loyalties.
trumps economic spiel is not a plan, its a bunch of unattainable goals that would blowup deficit &amp; debt 4 the rch
you don't know what your talking about
seems like a good folo question would be, "mr. trump, why did obama have to prove his citizenship to you?"
good answer: because potus works for people, they are his boss, and can make any demands they deem fit.

she's sickening!! i mean her skin is so rich, body so fluid, and she radiates.
the media are finally acknowledging trump was not making fun of a disabled reporter. they owe him an apology.
ur twitter profile says mom and not worst mom on planet. may wanna switch that.
lol will be pleased :p
who is this sob &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; just blocked me. never even talked him once. so many insecure people
why doesn't trump's wife ever appearance with him? only his daughter. odd.
dumps wife is an illegal alien. she's hiding in the shadows like so many others of her kind.
this is why the scotus argument for trump doesn't hold water. if reagan couldn't be trusted.....
judges are supposed to follow law they're lawless when they don't.problem =our lawmakers/congress refuse to amend it &amp; fund it

how can you explain trump's refusal to acknowledge the legitimacy of the current president other than a desire to please racist supporters?
he actually believes it too
the shiny object slipped past the media,warts and all. racism/bigotry/hate,all given a pass.the country's well was poisoned for a generation

instead of driving jobs and wealth away, america will become the world's great magnet for innovation &amp; job creation!

good luck w/your hopeful assist on the hillary "refresh" button narrative. where are bank speech transcripts?she needs to reset trust.
do you realize that needly picky nibbling at trump,silence on clinton's unwillingness 2 share speech transcripts = virtual/moral tie?
not easy for trump to flip on birtherism:1. supporters believe it 2. never admits error 3. have to admit he didnt believe what he was saying
your continued statements supporting hillary and undermining gop will eject you to wilderness after election. bon voyage.
daily kos is a dumb site. no one is going to get good #'s until they include 3rd party!

didn't nbc learn anything after allowing trump to host snl? did anyone actually think jimmy fallon would be hard on him? i mean, honestly.
its a comedy show, why would he be hard on him?
cnn poll of polls: clinton leads trump by 2 points, which means it's a tie. all trend lines moving toward trump.

when i cast my vote 4 hillary i will leave the polling station knowing i made the best decision 4 commander-in-chief

"i'm sorry" is never a complete sentence, is it? it's either "i'm sorry, and ..." or "i'm sorry, but...." or ugh, "i'm sorry, okay?????????"
to me, "i'm sorry, and..." is the only right way to sorry. i don't even like "i'm sorry full stop." because there's a reason you're sorry.
“nothing in the world is more exciting than a moment of sudden discovery or invention ..."

what will bernie sanders do if trump wins? "try to overcome my depression" and "figure out where we go from there"
how much damage can trump do over 4 years? despoil the environment. check. create huge deficits. check. market crash. check....

trump! what could go wrong? his voodoo economics creates market crash, recession. for starters.
so the prophet pbuh himself negotiating with the jews that lived at the time, what does that make him? 🤔
such ignorance. appalling that these creatures have the audacity to question people's faith because of a bloody pic.
happy birthday 🎉 have a good one 😊

trump still creates loophole that goes beyond ryan plan to cut rates on biz income to 15%, letting trump pay lower rate than many families.
twenty four hours later, i still stand by this prebuttal tweet 👇
yes "of the two humans who can be physically elected president, vote for the one you like better" is real radical.
right and they don't have to earn that. they just stand around like a show horse
the sleeping giant has awakened ! blacks are not voting for hillary !
rightly so..dems just want the vote.look at chicag.etc. trump is a negotiator who wins and gets things done

hormoneless tweeting endocrinology bites behind unseen curves i am truly on the fence today. menopause w/ no ovaries
no one told me there would be days like this. the endo says 'catastrophic' as they can't prescribe what's gone 4now
to point out where we are this am. with bated breath, we're waiting for someone to confirm they think is an actual us citizen.
you media folks have given trump such a low bar and pass and gone out the way to damage hrc. please don't act concerned now.
no. he clearly is doing this for himself. his entire manner in this race should make this fully obvious to you.
what is obvious to me is that he has the characteristics of a strong leader n part of that is having a strong sense of self.
she is not worthy of our votes sir.to many lies told .trump may not be the best pick but he sure knows how to reach us.
with lies. read politicususa or politifact to know what's true &amp; what isn't. you owe it to yourself &amp; america.

so, friends of privilege (and this is intersectional, you can have non black privilege w/o white privilege, male but not able-bodied, etc.)
donald trump has by turns praised and vilified the fed chair, janet yellen, and the fed’s interest-rate policies.
the trump crash is coming. voodoo economics, deficit spending, drastic spending cuts will spur the sell off. make america kansas!
krauthammer: 'this is an election about nothing'
kraut is a has been totally wrong since beginning

replace insurance status with education or income and you get the same flawed, pointless study who funded this, and why?

ok. thanks for your reply.
johnson should be allowed in the debates if for no other reason than to set up a dynamic of two adults vs. one big fat baby.
more importantly: it sets up the dynamic of johnson as clinton's *true* opponent, leaving trump's third wheel in the dust.

but now mr birther is recanting- proving he will say anything. will his supporters notice or care about this major flip flop?
nope. and the perfidy of the news media is already baked in.
i wonder where donald jr 1st heard the reference "warming up the gas chamber" bc i see it often in tweets to me from trump supporters
what is worse, the holocaust reference itself or that he thinks that the gas chambers were warmed up.

don't feel bad for us. we chose to wade in this mess.
tip for my media friends: cover his press conference today and don't mention it was at his new hotel in dc. watch the infantile fury.
thought he doesn't care about his business. using campaign to promote. insane.
why? most voters are idiots and he knows he can run you around breathlessly reporting on every dump he takes.
you went further out on the limb last week, and now he's sawing it off behind you. that's the reason for this tweet.
maybe he hasn't insulted you directly, but that shouldn't let him off the hook. and in fact, he has attacked women.
you're right, he hasn't insulted me directly but his missteps r more due to his political incorrectness not insincerity.

once you have a clot, you take blood thinners - for life normally! pneumonia also kills a lot of people daily!
heart disease is the number 1 killer &amp; trump takes meds for it.
6 us states have already seen snow! are you ready??
no! never ready for snow. prius isn't so good driving in it. need 4w drive!

but c'mon charley it's friday and we need to gleefully speculate about takeover targets
ha. they could still be right. just saying.
honestly a pretty big fan of ottessa moshfegh's anger levels.
excellent writer's tip: get hostile.
finding great joy in watching this older woman with impeccable style on the subway judge this 20 something with a shredded denim jacket on
she literally took her shades off just to size her up.
i just spent too much on a harley quinn costume...

quick paced conversation about setting up a meet. fastest way to kill it? ask him for a face pic. now silence for 4 days.

sanders: i'll 'try to overcome my depression' if trump wins | getty
that new sports car you bought should help now shouldn't it ? fcuk that communism sh1t eh bern?
well, here's a hint. "medicaid isn't good enough, we need coverage from private, for-profit insurance companies!"
thanks for the "news" on health insurance from a non-profit associated with a giant insurance provider
im disappointed n i voted4 him&amp; felt that he just rolled over after rigged the election
i know that bsanders will hold hrc accountable everyday. we have the vote the greater good.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
they want to believe a narrative so badly,it doesnt matter the words are empty-only that theyre said
because bernie hasn't done what he said he'd do, and the berniebots are continuing to trash hillary.
i am curious why you are not attacking gary johnson, the candidate youth say they will vote for?
shit to personal ... and feminine
it's as personal as you make it &amp; negative, i know tons of dude with it and they don't portray as feminine
hugs and thanks
thank you. have a great weekend :-)
really hope we don't have to put up with these guys at the . and here's why -&gt;
couldn't agree more. they seem to be having a good time but spoil it for others.

i love "lie to me too"...ahhh so happy you finally got to hear it.

call your publicist.
then call your mom, it's that kind of day.
at least it's friday!
then i got pulled over while texting my parents about the accident!!
wow liberals are insane and kinda creepy
you think that's insane &amp; creepy? man, what do you think of trump mocking the disabled and saying he'd date his daughter?
it's crazy cause last week before the jets played i needed a rb and he asked me if i wanted him and i said no it's ok 😩😩😩😩
omg!!! 😂😂😂😂 maybe better off. don't want to change the good karma right now.
how we getting out there?
lmaooooo , i don't mind driving but i don't have that much space
that is what we tell you guys, to not hurt feelings. 😜
that's hilarious !
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
psychologically,the tactics they're using are powerful. hillary is so debilitated she's only a prop
how we getting out there?
we gonna have to take a few cars
he said he don't see color or race either.
anyone can have straight hair. straight hair is all genetics. you can't appropriate genetics. fuck outta here.
dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?
do your jobs and point out that he is lying might be a place to start.
trump talking up medicaid as a means of replacing some of obamacare. i can’t imagine his party embracing this.
the problem is you sam! you continue to divide america rather than solutions &amp; viable compromises.
traitors oo! the trump is needed for balance. apparently hilary has pneumonia! are there any talks of conceding?
balance? ha! u want a bigot for balance😂killing me dude!hillary ain't going nowhere! fyi not that i like that female.
so i think it's safe to say that walk off home run and the announcement of is the definition of a exceptional thursday.
also, i think it must be said that my next hat in my collection should be pink.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
but it doesn't matter.make her look good when she is seen and have the right things said on tv &amp; sm
saw this and it strikes me as exactly the type of thing people are mad about when they say there's false equivalency
this type of vapid chatter is really confined to cable filling hours. lots of other media doing strong, critical coverage of born candidates
i'm totally happy to. the bernie brigade seems to disagree.
maybe, just maybe could try disdaining youth from voting gary johnson, the actual threat.
i'm so hesitant on tickets cuz idk if genbeauty is gonna be too much
i always pick one makeup showcase a year like i can't do imats and the makeup show its too much 😩

when you deny the legitimacy of the first black president, it does not look like an accident--only a dog whistle
i disagree that this is brilliant. she is showing her hand for debate. their campaign is a .
i don't think she'll do the debates
she's a corrupt liar. if you're so easily taken in by a slogan then you deserve her.
america doesn't deserve a traitor like trump who loves dictators &amp; lies habitually. politicususa

you aren't a little upset about that one elderly woman who was mobbed at one of his rallies this week? typical of his events.

you can bet it wont be his blood.
people that wear open toed sandals/flip flops to the airport are a different breed of ew
where r u going?
"guarantees a whole lot of follow up" is pretty optimistic based on what we've seen the last few months
trump has has so much bad press, but i could see an argument for it being more shallow.
ok but like imagine having ur right foot in gakus ass and the other foot in yamatos so its like yamato and gaku are ur shoes and u walk,
i'm the person who has my foot shoved up gaku's ass
again? trouble for the congress in arunachal, 44 mlas led by pema khandu merge with the people's party

we need you to vote for hrc and hold her and your local elected officials accountable.

thank you 🤗
as med records aren't a matter of course for potus campaigns-who knows how many took blood thinners?

what is.....a pony roll
stop checking for me and worry about your mf self bitch!
lol obsessed ctfu its ridiculous how much u talk but never say shiy to chelse. bitch ur pathetic
and as a result of birtherism, 40% of trump supporters believe obama was not born in the u.s.
more likely as a result of bigotry and/or poor education
what's new on heinz field menu? franco's sausages, $15 fries, pork on pork sandwich

history: 9/11: 3,000 dead. iraq: 4,500+ dead, katrina fiasco, 2007 recession. trump advised by same conservative ideologues.
aww...wish i could,especially with paddles standing by 😁 sure you'll do great!👊🏻 up for a hike tho?

the not so veiled threat embedded in this section of brooks' column is chilling: "get in line or be hung out to dry"
i was hoping this was satire when i started it
it's disingenuous as is her entire campaign. mook is a bumbling idiot.
disingenuous are the clinton lives. it is her turn to be a used meat puppet
this lady just called to check in right now???? like check in is at 3 lady

imo larger european cage standards where chicken can move around spread wings etc is better then cage free.
my birds roam fields all day and go inside at night
to attack is to legitimize him. that's worse than clinton or trump to all the party leaders.
winning 26% of the youth vote has already legitimized gary johnson.

there is viable deal to be made if team wants to stay in oak - to much to say on - have shared views on radio/tv, may do so again.

terraforming mars is ages 12+, but i always think that, for smart "gamer kids", you can subtract 2 years.
i mean, trump *should* disavow it, of course. but it's not like all is instantly forgotten once he says the words.
whats trump expect obama to say "thanks"?
"i stand before you today to tell you, that blogger was wrong, dammit."
"i want to use 45 minutes of this hour to tell you exactly why. the last 15 minutes will be appropriative call and response."

donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
depending on how question is phrased is key: ask "do you really think trump's a bigot or is that a media invention" &amp; c what u get
: btw, your video ads automatically play, which it makes it impossible to start watch any articles you post with videos.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
he'll get credit for "putting the issue behind him." meanwhile will hillary even try to give a reason to be for her?
be for hillary because she's sure obama was born in the usa! usa has no other problems, so that's that!
reporters today covering trump don't forget to ask him why he questioned potus' admittance to harvard as well.
he said he is going to blame this on hrc today. said this on fox business this morning.
i bought a frozen pizza. good night.

trump campaign praises trump for forcing first black president to produce his birth certificate to prove he's legit

the protest ride you saw was this: too many 🚶‍♀️ &amp; 🚴‍♀️ deaths on our streets, too little action.
donald trump jr. on "gas chamber" remarks: "poor choice of words" but "i wasn't talking about the holocaust:"
like father like son!
how can you be so insensitive? police are shooting harambe's family down in the street and all you can think about is hurting joy

yes you should watch it. a milestone in the normalization of racism, xenophobia, hatred…
nope. it's not a huge deal but i use playlists to manage what i sync with each of my devices, so it's annoying.
wait just kidding it lost my whole library, not just playlists. i have it, but i need to reimport which is annoying on many levels.

says the man without 5 homeless shelters in one area 🤔🤔🤔
when another opened in my district this year, i supported despite some loud early voices of opposition.
no, didn’t “misstate key facts,” he straight out told bald faced lies about rev. faith green timmons,...
a disgrace on the pastors part! he was respectful and attacked nobody. you want to stay depressed vote dem.
have you looked at hillary lately?
i have seen her but i am not a doctor and wouldn't go to one who makes patently false ridiculous claims in writing
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you have done nothing but lie about all 6 months - you have nothing to run on, but lies for the gop !!!
yeah i cant wait!
me either.. looking forward to the tailgate.. i'm stoked.. n seeing a bunch of y'all is going to be great
we're looking for a house to rent in the winter n just found one thts $900 for a month rental this is gonna b a disaster
ooo, where, trying to do somethi g similar.
:( so long . you've been good to me.
lots of us use outlook here. it's a great app.
trump won't fully disavow his birther crap because too many of his followers really believe obama wasn't born in u.s.
i felt true shame that president obama felt the need to even react to this crap. i would've told them all to go to hell!
lmao why they on my dick lmfaoooo
they love you lmao
flint pastor: trump started to go beyond planned talking points
but if hillary had done that, she would have been freely allowed to speak. silencing a potus candidate is un-american!
yeah he should have made him open a pre-opened pickle jar instead.
sounds like it would fit in with trump's skill set
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- try to defend the 105k slimey ass muslims that pres oslimey wants to bring in next month. bullshit - we can't afford them

trump's talking abt it b/c media is. loudmouth matthews using it to get ratings as he did w/abortion. media demeans the nation.

this just proves how confident he is, young mind, feeling good, great stamina, non-stop blue color candidate!
i agree. it's a challenge but there are a lot of educators actively working against that in their classrooms. that's hope.
absolutely - definitely need and continue to need people like you fighting the good fight 🙌🏽

you'd think most classrooms are churches with how much folks speak up in them. sure, no one wants to be the guy delaying class constantly...
but if the instructor asks a question- protip: you're supposed to speak up. share. "what is your air management policy? do you practice it?"
that's bullshit about teachers. my mother taught high school and proud union member. her students loved her.
instead of individuals i am talking about the system. finding the teacher who can change lives is rare. it shouldn't be.

if she doesn't do debates she loses election. it will be the final nail in her coffin.
i'm not sure i agree.remember,they only need plausible deniability.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you cannot defend this shit any more. you have broken more laws than any other woman on earth !!!!
if you want to see what is wrong with media coverage of this campaign look at the wall to wall on trump's birther history.
trump will spin this as his campaign has already started to dump stuff on clinton. lies dragged behind lies. which leads me to a question ..
i didn't realize you had that low of an opinion about teachers.
i have a very high opinion of the power of the great teacher. it is a miracle how they can change lives.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
also do you recall if it was desktop or mobile?
oh i know i agree, i was just saying going forward as coquelin has become a liability.

if it's coming from a business, it's always "too good to be true" mike. short run vs long run.
yeah, you're right. was just thinking even with costing a little more, easing upgrade process would be worth it...
weird--why did barackobama sr. fail to list as his son in his 1961 ins application?
why does forget his youngest daughter in every speech?
father time remains undefeated. he has officially caught up with darrelle revis.
caught up last year. getting burned just confirms it. year with pats? ring and a shot knee.
if it's coming from a business, it's always "too good to be true" mike. short run vs long run.
but that doesn't appear to be the case

if she doesn't do debates she loses election. it will be the final nail in her coffin.
2 of 3 voting machines co.s are controlled by companies that support of clinton.didn't you see the email detailing it?
that's bullshit about teachers. my mother taught high school and proud union member. her students loved her.
a proud union member is just what every teacher should be. it's the system that stifles them. just like politicians.

hi twitter, i'm back! 🤓
- welcome back, we missed you!!! 😘😘
you want to understand the alt-right? read this. via
what's to understand? pres. obama made it clear with his "god, guns and gays" comment. how prescient.
i'll be back in ny october 15-18
oh my pre birthday? yassssssss
besides, kritter is still asleep and i am in a good mood.
we don't want to disturb the harmony then 😉
massive 21 minute speech by crooked hillary yesterday. outstanding! if went 30 minutes or less- msm would have a field day.
she is not well enough to do more.
yes black ppl, keep voting dem; stay stupid. enjoy the lies and ruined cities.
or you, the outright bigotry from the gop
no, the plan is to stop us from becoming a minority. you speak of it as if it were written in stone. but we can stop it.
ur an idiot. an idiot drowning in denial. rational white folks realize it ain't the end of the world. so enlighten me how are --
a downside of twitter is that i have a character limit and can't point out all the factually incorrect things here:
maybe donald trump is rich on money but the sad fool is poor on everything else his kids follow
same!!!!!!!!!! you coming to this?
of course its my last webster night before i move!
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- there is no way that you can get away with all the laws you have broken and lying to american moms
i don't want to die so it would be nice if single payer were a thing

apple won’t even let me get in line until my reservation window opens. much different from last year.
they have your name on a very special list of people to keep waiting. i know a guy.
we need to stop rewarding ppl who want 2 multiply like rabbits. obama/dems reward being irresponsible. if u want 2 choose 2 multiply-u pay
agreed. sadly, been that way forever. the ones that need it have too much pride to take it while others milk the system.
oh noooo the next chainsmokers song is w/ chris martin?? god save us all!! 😷

hahaha that was my favorite part too
judge: "and who is representing the defense?" defendant: "i don't see how that's any of your business."
he looks younger and fitter than some 35yr olds i've seen 😁
if you have seen 35 year olds who look older and less fit than donald trump than they were in severe medical distress.

join me as i rewrite history. i will announce my new reality show, "whose lie is it anyway"?
agreed. although watching obama humiliate trump at correspondents dinner in 2011 was hilarious; makes it almost worth it
i agree. that was great. but, that's exactly the reason i would've told dump to go eff himself.

trump wants to ban muslims from the u.s. while hillary has been very busy bombing muslims in other countries. these are appalling options.
i dislike everything about hillary, but her trying to deal with the enemy. same with donald. he never said all, just enemies.

we need to release nonviolent drug offenders from prison and remove such offenses from their record so they're not locked out of society.

such irrelevant news , cnn has really gone in the tank
watch: lets jimmy fallon mess up his hair on late night tv.
there was nothing funny about that. trump is a white nationalist and fallon is giving him a platform.
if trump actually renounces birtherism today, the better question is why have you been lying about it for six years?

trump reigniting birtherism after both conway and giuliani tried to bury it for him just shows how cunning he is. or something.

demand -&gt; higher prices, higher prices -&gt; weaker demand??? that is economic loop-di-loop.
i wouldn't confuse rent &amp; healthcare price rise w/demand push. supply imbalances and 3rd party payor issues, respectively.

one thing that distinguishes mode media from other silicon valley failures is that people are not pretending to grieve for mode.
well, they owe us all money.
if trump is about to do what i think he's about to do, i think it's going to backfire on him quite badly.
if his story is "hillary invented birtherism and i'm the one who debunked it," that's an obvious lie, not unusual for trump. but.
i'll go out of my way to get away from whatever i'm doing just so i can tap out a rhythm pattern or something

it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.

it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.
it is a lie that -- maybe -- even some voters who don't realize trump has been lying to them all the time will know is a lie.

to borrow a phrase from a prominent man, "how stupid are the people of this country?" he's finally underestimating the public intelligence.

i don't understand how trump's campaign isn't in the trash can with everything he says and does.
i almost admire his brilliance of appealing to the idiots of america because there are so many of them.

he learned that from the clintons

: says trump owes obama, americans apology over birther claims
hold on! her camp started the birther claims in 2008. this is bullshit
in ’s defense, i’m lately getting _super_ confused by packages where it’s not clear if it’s official or not.
it's almost as if established trademark law had a purpose to it...

how not? he needed to adjust, get them help, make a change in fly. good coaches do that
there's only so much you can do from the sidelines. he can't make these guys turn and look at the ball
i hope it is that hillary is dropping out!
we can only hope but it's mainly about birther issue.

you obviously missed the episode where fallon pressed xi jinping on his south china sea policies
birtherism was never misunderstanding. it was tool trump used to build his rep with white supremacists via
was he really that strategic about it back then?
easy way out would be to make one in python
i put a significant python system into production at a prev job, so that would be cheating.
a pass? my thread is littered w/stupid threats because pushing on trump for playing with such an ugly topic

a word about anti-blackness &amp; school law enforcement. the term "police state" is redundant; you have no indissoluble rights, period.
the "rule of law" is pure ideological abstraction from ownership. even schools embody a physical fight for who owns the law and who obeys.
donald trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
just like all other men
pretty sure soundcloud notified me about a 2nd side remix from an artist i don’t follow

that fits the conventional narrative around conservation, but the existing plans are hardly a "dream verdict" for industry.

dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?
call him out as a liar, manipulator and huckster. you are losing your street cred
...suspended or expelled for behaving how anyone would given their conditions it is remiss to criminalize them. try to imagine police ...
...wrestling wealthy white males in business suits to the ground, pointing guns into their shiny bmws,shooting them to death at will...
purely coincidence. purely.
and media is saying, why now? good thing i have a nice stack of magazines on the coffee table to hurl a the tv.

if "not warranted" decision keeps stakeholders at the table, includes strong grouse plans &amp; avoids esa backlash, that's a win
i think this "esa backlash" concern that seems so in fashion among conservationists is a major strategic error.
how many iphones have you ever owned
7: 3gs, 4s, 5s, 6, replacement 6 for broken mute switch, 6s+, 7+.
not risking embarrassment is more important than dismantling privilege, &amp; erasing evidence of wrongdoing is easier than a sincere apology.
learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
i don't believe dena ever took a leave of absence. she came back to stop whatever she didn't approve of.
dena's so called leave of absence was in august, meaning 6 months of reboot was her writing. now she's trying to shirk responsibility.
i'd love to attend as i am a big fan

donald trump is unfit to be president. we just can’t accept this. we’ve got to stand up to this. if we don’t, it won’t stop.
you are not fit because of your health
thanks lol and usually in torched for my psychotic takes on twitter
we've all been there. this team has a way of doing that to a guy. they should make prozacs with little buffalos on them

then being exonerated...day after day. you can't, it's unthinkable.daily reality for black youth is literally unimaginable to white folks...
...in the paradigm in which hoodies are red herrings to homogenize black bodies with criminality but white hoods and badges aren't.
it does, fuckwad. when someone lies you should tell your readers.
i read the article to ultimately come out agreeing with you.
learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
work from home also exists, she expect us to believe she didnt skype in lol
lol. she is clearly delusional. unprofessional too, blaming her fellow writer and thinking she alone knows what's good.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.

i know what trending is. i was referring to facebook, which is america's most widely read news source.
yeah, just don’t think it’s fair for journos to keep equating trending’s influence to the news feed.
six weeks in and the enormity of the end of a relationship and moving home is hitting hard for the first time.
ugh, i'm sorry. that is such a shitty time.

personally i might upgrade, my expectation was low to begin and think they surpassed it
if trump owns it he will likely try to cast himself as helping country resolve a real issue.
he already did this in his campaign statement - it's an absolute outrage! i sure hope this energizes hrc's base to vote.
i’m ok with that, too. but my list doesn’t start with russ.
i kind of agree. i just rather get rid of anyone associated with putting together any roster from 2000-2014
perhaps calling black youth "super predators" wasn't a great idea.
no it wasnt !!!! hoping the black community's have realized clinton will do nothing for you but take your vote :(
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
when you gaffe again, you alienate more people. receipts pile up. if not on twitter, irl. rumors spread. word gets around.
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
but, but, he is the president, his home country could not be kenya. she mis-spoke, yea right.
i'm noticing now that i can go long periods of time without the tv on, which prior would be on as long as i was home either stream or cable
not that i paid attention to it the entire time - i certainly couldn't but there used to be something about the constant noise that i needed
no. definitely not overrated. top-6 in three straight years despite topping 140 tgts once. one injury.
but how far off was he from julio/ab/obj in points? i have to look more into it. but i doubt it's close

digby likes to address sadness with face licks, which is nice in theory but also kinda gross
i cannot contain my feelings about this. you can't be down looking at that face.
feels like it's just too soon for a movie about that disaster
are you talking about america or deepwater horizon?
our road is blocked. this truck is trying to drop off product. actual disaster. this business is forsaken by god
clearly the gods are telling you to relocate may i recommend lovely hillside, coincidentally the next town over from me

hillary clinton: “barack obama was born in america... and donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.”

i see you've basically answered my question already. sorry about that one.
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
trump needs these 3 things to win over black voters:
why even publish this garbage article?

good question i have wondered about this too
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
i struggled with that because i fear the statement is harmful, but ultimately i want to own my harm.
awkwardly tweeted this morning about how i wanted jimmy fallon to run for president before i heard/saw his little bit with trump.
so naturally i immediately deleted the tweet and now i have some feelings and y not get them out, so hi twitter.
i hate it when hotels have body wash instead of bars of soap.
bars of soap are for the olds. and super wasteful since you'd never use a whole one and then they are thrown out.

yeah. i'm not sure though. how about monday night. they might give us our checks early
what is this!!!! explain right now 😤
you play with him?
we sure can!
i'm serious. i know you're a trip planning goddess.
the presence of love &amp; hard work doesn't prevent total failure as a result. do people delegitimize the term w/overuse? yeah.
one person's opinion of an interpretable piece of expression doesn't define it for everyone.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
how many times does he have to say they are being audited.

why are there so many species of bugs, but so few species of human?
because humans destroy each other and can't live in harmony like bugs can. more human species will destroy the planet faster
i thinks he's worse than that. trump makes george w look statesman like in comparison.

since the move to 1.0.0, ive needed to add `--repo-update` to `pod install` every time ive run it 😑
depending on what you’re doing then, you may want to use `pod update [pod_name]` instead?
trump has shown again and again that what he aims for is attention--for whatever. almost doesn't matter why. today is a good example.
let him keep on inflating as it will lead to something big ....

yea, a large part of the population completely agrees with him... the worst dual standard in reporting i've seen in 60 years

and that really hurt.

the polls are closer than ever, and the stakes couldn't be higher. chip in today.

maybe a better temperament because she would be unconscious most of the time from passing out

lies are deplorable
pass it on! is unamerican-be patriotic &amp; vote for pro american
this statement from the trump campaign on obama's american roots is pathetic, demeaning and shameful. screw them.

the school is lying saying that they left school "on their own accord." they know damn well they sent them back home.

also i thought that form was the "oops we screwed up, let us know what you'll be looking for so we can manage stock for upgrade program"

this does absolutely nothing to his supporters who feel like hillary is just as bad as, if not worse than, trump.
anyone who feels that way is... not with it. at all.
i was smirking and birdman rubbing my hands together after the first paragraph knowing it would be good.

i just turned my tv on &amp; it was on cnn, red assure its not anymore

they'll "report the story" josh.

i'd be more on board with libertarians if they started by attacking the military-intelligence-industrial complex, instead of, say, education
liberals are already doing the latter for them anyways via privatization

bernie sanders on trump's claim that he we get bernie supporters: "please, do not — anybody — confuse trump with me"
no we wont-you purchase a third house-that's how socialism works for leaders-not the peasants
.: "[trump] is feeding into the worst impulses: the bigotry and bias that lurks in our country."
so speaks the bigot!
trump jr. in 2014 praised his dad's "moral conviction" on obama birtherism
nice that u praise daddy 4 his racist agenda-he trys to invalidate our 1st black pres -moral conviction my ass!

she's a lying pos just like the rest of them disgusting family
it took me 5 minutes to find the bathroom but it's fine cause i guarantee my prof is still ranting on hillary

trump tells too much truth? now this will be a problem btwn us, going forward. how can you say this man "tells too much truth"?
he is gloriously honest to a fault. look at how dirty colin powell talked in secret, trump will say it in the open. just true
i cry every day

no, it hurts me that hillary recently stated she was against gay rights. that's what hurts me. you like it?
1) not that recent, 2) the republican platform is against gay marriage and trump's vp is most anti-lgbt pol in us
has he released his emails? if he did, you know he'd have much worse things than powell. you know that, right? he'll be full 1/
he doesn't do email, never believed in it. everything u need to know about him is in public. he speaks his mind everyday
she means mine, because we're married she gets to claim it partially.
oh! i didn't know you were married! huzzah!!
had a dream i was at denny's with and i said i love denco's and somehow won a huge flat screen tv for saying that. honestly wth?
congratulations tho
for info, i was "doored" off my bike. didn't even see it, must have hit the front of the bike. lucky in many ways, and helped by many too.
at least you live in a country where cycling is dangerous enough to wear a helmet!
moving cap tables and private portfolio management to the cloud is super powerful:
often, a cap table is more of a 'guideline', where access to that information is fiercely protected and frankly even obfuscated.
islam is no more violent than christianity, and christians have committed more terrorist acts than muslims
yes: crusades as an example. actually both are very similar if you look past 'naming' the creator.
cannot wait to go!!! go ahead have 1 more, i won't tell! lol. were they big or mini?
haha. i like how you think! the cannolis were the perfect size. and best part. the choco chips in the filling.

omg i know! remind me which one this was?
i think his name is alex? really annoying voice black glasses
i'd like to take this moment to point out that is the only candidate that doesn't travel with his press corps. the only 1.
trump understands the press is not there to help him,but to purposely make him look bad. so better off not having the propool

islam is no more violent than christianity, and christians have committed more terrorist acts than muslims
it's the fanaticism that sheds poor light on all religion. practicing for oneself rather than others is key.
haha come pick me up ;)

thanks for your support of public lands!
have had my senior pass for some time now. nationalparks are a must to visit.our heritage
it's not the price. you could price it for 50$ and they still lied about being an online game.
price played into it , indie game for 60 is setting expectations too high for that studio
it's a beautiful theory! it'd be awesome if it were true.
i liked the, like, vague feminism of it. can man science explain breasts?????
mostly the same people, is all i am saying.

happy friday denise i see you are a comedian where can i see some of your work i can use some laughing therapy in my life
remember, dena bragged up the necktie storyline saying it will go on for a while just like she is now with the criminals.
dena loves to use storylines to get ratings then she lets it all go to crap again once they have a renewal. returns will leave again.
respect here is a idea of that: try to listen when you can &amp; get back to me.peace
. i will take a listen
trump tells fbn i was "very rude" to ivanka and "really attacked" her "viciously" and calls me "non intelligent"

let's be very clear here. trump is the enemy. donald and his greedy family will never be president
trump is literally running for president as a giant marketing campaign for his ego and properties. and many conservatives are defending it!
he will put assets into "blind trust" kids running people believe it would be blind . dear leader says it so true

1) there is no 28...missing 57 so i assume it's him. 2) 48 should stay with 19-8, best line in hockey in 2nd half

thanks to our friends at , here's a new video of us singing "jolene" w/ !

trump must use some really great glue.
spends a lot of money on those hair extensions
every person opinions is based on their own personal experience or lack there of .
i think you onto something...
the only foods i ever get when orders our groceries is greens, frozen pizza and eggs. what kind of life am i living? really😂

donald trump calls reporter who grilled ivanka “non-intelligent”
is that a word?
who cares about trump campaign, we want to see him say it . he's a racist lying con man
sadly still more honest than former lady secretary
going out this weekend? we’ve got you covered. here’s a code from bud for a ride home.
no thank you!! don't trust illegal uber or lyft!! only yellow/ green nyc cab !
the gameweek 5 deadline is in three hours don't get caught out...
lad help me. nolito or de bruyne?
here's that prometheus deleted scene . wish they left it in.
i find it weird how far along the cgi is. i mean it's practically done. wonder why they canned it
donald trump was the birther-in-chief. he is still the birther-in-chief.
correction: and are.
but the point that density is achievable without high rises is very important and small devs need to be allowed.
just saying it's not some newfangled thing &amp; 2x is trivial. paris is also 14x as dense as boulder w/o high rises.
truly amazed that w/additional days 2 think &amp; plan, hillary is still one-note johnna. is that all she's got? "go to her website for issues"?
that's all she has
nothing to see here. it's just another paid supporter.
proped up by media
any journalist who covers trump's racist birtherism as he said/she said story should resign immediately. no time for false equivalence
maybe the press should just boycott an announcement from him for a change. just not cover his ass for a chng
we love this slide from showing the aging populations across the globe.
what's with the stereotype icons? all japanese work in rice paddies and all americans are cowboys?
personally i think that's stupid af then!! i love when openers are actually killin it and doin good
an opener will never get a gig again if he tries to go harder than the opener..
trump says he'll make a "major statement" on obama birther issue today:
anything for a photo-op
maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.
the color of your skin makes up one of millions of characteristics that make humans beings complex.
i got my playset of anime chandra! i cant believe there hasnt been a supplemental anime product, like ftv: anime
kamigawa masterpieces: anime bullshit, a 54 card subset. moe noble hierarch moe stoneforge mystic ...and more!

joseph looks very different than i'd imagined
don't forget in primary she called republicans the enemy/traitors
that she did
heres what occurs when you wrap your teeth in aluminum foil
that aluminum tin foil on teeth looks uncomfortably painful!
little big news. 1. i quit my job 😢. 2. i got a new job ☺. 3. i still can't get anyone to publish my book 😢. all in all, im doin ok....ish

time. read this and you could win a code for : the collection on xbox one. good luck.
because it is so visually beautiful. and i loved the history behind it.
yes. absolutely. all who died. all who die in ongoing war of ideals. how about who we might call love?
i see your point and appreciate it but love is a concept and feeling not a god
hahaha do you? what's on it
those listed songs plus "booty me down" "trampoline booty" +others
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
good pointvto bring forward
coincidence? about past the 1 year mark? wife’s watch battery seems to be failing too.
i bought mine on the first day, so maybe. it's at 100% this morning, hopefully that was just a missed charge.
heard the same thing from my friend who works above the apple 5th ave. store.
good to know! i was shocked by this line
my bedroom this morning. castle pass on the pct. a short dirt road off of i-80 meets the trail here.
now back to babylon.
kinda over my liquid foundation... i wanna try something new but i don't want something with spf b/c of flashback &amp; i want a dewy finish 🤔
any recommendations??
again, rumor not proven to come from clinton or her campaign. also see
so if you say, rumor not proven, why bother arguing it? are you privy to some information the rest of america isn't?
i'm not a crazy person so didn't flip out... but what now? they took my name and number and said they'd call me.
troubling. harkening back to the early days of iphone but this is worse because expectations were explicitly set and missed.
this is why fell below msnbc. network of bathhouse club members it is
obama on his way out. what difference does it make??? don't care what planet he was born on.
we’ll see how many other djs do it now. just send out father’s day card in the mail before hand. hahaha
lmao that's jokes because i'm from queens it's like a must to spin that only right lol
time. read this and you could win a code for : the collection on xbox one. good luck.
i would choose rapture. watching the sea life while living in the ocean would be surreal!
to the love of redheads
i fucking love a hot redhead! 😍
watch msnbc in 2011: saying hillary clinton started the birther movement.
now they prop her up
anyone in need of some graphic work, or logos...i got time, limited time only 😎
send me your email
so we're no longer jimmy fallon fans cause he interviewed trump?
he can interview whoever, his questions are very soft though. does this to all his guest.
and you as well, weirder. you are a shining beacon of light in a world sometimes full of darkness. a magic missile of hope.
some may think magic missiles of hope cast into the darkness are futile. but once in awhile they hit someone and brighten all.
shoutout to the former boss. yass!!
- watched on he pushed our agenda 2 where it should b-hope he can get his kids 2 get out &amp; vote 4 h
yes, i'm going to check out goblin cock tonight. don't know much about them.
weird name never heard of them 🤔i don't think
in weird way it's beneficial that racist people share on a public platform if the job goes to equally qualified non racist person
ideally they wouldn't be so narrow minded... but at least they are publicly documenting their stupidity for all to see.
when you weren't there.
dude just stop 😂 please show us the link where it states that the owner already approved the move
yeah and stop putting these thots all over your snap, so fucking tired
i like when you talk to me like that baby
honored to speak @ taxpayers against fraud conference last night. here w/whistleblower of year, david kester.
speaking of fraud, when will you indict ?
level of tired: i just put mascara on my eyebrow
part two: i showed up to school at 8am today.....i don't have class on fridays
just love garnet &amp; gold, don't really care for all whites or all garnet either, but at least those aren't cursed by a gypsy
my favorite alternate is white top garnet pants.
i got one the second i got to respectables bc i couldn't wait any longer
i feel you on that
i find it weird how far along the cgi is. i mean it's practically done. wonder why they canned it
damn. it actually makes more sense why he was curled up too--to hide his lengthened limbs
ugh yes!! you can copy my notes &amp; study guide too
sweet. or you can text me pictures of your notes and i'll copy them that way😂
it's a little weird when the phone is completely off as it does nothing. nice unlocking as there's no more "push"
so it’s definitely going to take time to get used to it.
the democratic nominee is sending old folks to ohio to tell scary stories about voting for . politics of fear is all she has.
the old two parties are nothing more than fear this fear that fear him fear her not much about important things
in the disney version? glenn close voiced his ape-mum, minnie driver voiced jane.

someone running for president of our great country is going to address an idiotic issue, with veterans to promote a hotel?
trump-the-schlockteaser! how cockyotic!
omg i loved soulcalibur that game gave me life lol. i hate they stopped making it. that was my favorite fighting game including mk
definitely my favorite as well. great story, great characters - endless hours of screaming and laughter. :d

help! can anyone think of some type-driven picture book covers?
the book w no pictures
on your way home you can stop in st lou and get a mini pig and a delicious sammich.
just don't make my mini pig into a delicious sammich
trump has been in the building for at least 15 mins, but still not at podium. getting a pep talk?
well there's a live feed elsewhere so we don't have to assume.
blocked in the uk ☹️
yeah my bad, i used a song that was copyrighted at the end of the video... sorry dude.
&amp; will out! accidentally lets truth slip about hillary’s ‘supporters’ during broadcast
hes the media village idiot. he&amp;biden must be buddies like dumb&amp;dumber
since ios 10 update, i wake up to negative news about daily. speaking of o.👇🏽
obozo was not born here! the truth will come out soon
you're answer
other la fan who's ass hurt 😭😂
new video: unboxing. you've all seen the black, but what's rose gold like? rt!
waiting vs samsung test .
let's take a look at the live chat while we wait for trump's event to start...
that's a lot of...wow
i had no idea there was a tag this is pretty neat
maybe there wasn't an actual but it was a trending topic and you dominated.
hm, that is really interesting. it very few people who actually hates music itself, so he rarely listen to music?
just disinterested in mainstream music. perhaps he likes classical but nothing under modern label control anyways
when i saw wanted to say: "you are the coolest, i have an overwhelming urge to hug u" played it cool: "ur talk was really good"
that’s usually how i play it too
the game accuses meek mill of being a snitch, threatens to beat him up.
the day of game continues with his meek mill diss song "92 bars"
when are we painting your room 🙄
lmao i hate you. pink is not that. but we should do it... painting &amp; drinks 🤔
trump was 63 minutes late to his own press conference.
but those were good minutes. let me tell you how good they were: you have no idea.
don't ever say "well it can't get any worse"
what about "i got a bad feeling about this"? that's still kosher, right?
appreciation day for this beautiful girl!💗😘
yes the best for last ❤️❤️
this painting is in trump's campaign hq via
. amazing. putin has the same one with small variations hanging in his office. uncanny.
good to know! i was shocked by this line
they've been getting ppl out of line all night in sf, making them reservations instead.
watch live: donald trump speaks at washington, dc, campaign event
nothing to watch here, this guy is a joke.
the owners are sick of that dirt coliseum that don't vegetate money. they want team in vegas bad. 🤑🤑🤑
ricky bobby is this other fake account you have 😂😂😂
the new is better, faster &amp; more powerful, but , is it powered by ?
like tim cook gives a damn?
the brazil and china ones are good
the brazil one is ok. had a lil bit of the greek tzatsiki one (could be better) and haven't had the chinese one. this owns tho
oh look! and some major free press for his new hotel. lol please! 🙅🏾
i must've missed this one but who is opening a new hotel.... you're too funny girl
if trump holds conference abt pbo bc &amp; blames hrc &amp; press stays silent they have abdicated their responsibility as press in a democracy 1/2
and are nothing more than stenographers for propaganda no different than pravda under ussr
maybe trump will actually announce that he is dissolving the massive conflict of interest that is the trump organization
except there isn't one... there's a live feed. blahaha!
there was a antitrust suit in the eyeglass industry in 1940. fdr broke the power of eyeglass companies to gouge.
eye gouging. ow.
any journalist who covers trump's racist birtherism as he said/she said story should resign immediately. no time for false equivalence

round them all up. they're dirty corrupt us hating globalists traitors. the us needs an enema!
exactly right! couldn't agree more
some may think magic missiles of hope cast into the darkness are futile. but once in awhile they hit someone and brighten all.
your abilities and magic are something few openly appreciate or understand. but everyone benefits from them.
you’re allowed your, admittedly wrong, opinion.
ya’ll are both wrong - mandarin orange is superior.
